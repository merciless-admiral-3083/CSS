/*now understand one thing, let say we have  line p, and we have something 
with <p id=*anything*, the one with id and one with non id both belongs to p, which means
p is the parent of all, so if i make a code as
p{
 color: red !important;   
} then no matter what you change in p or p id=...
the color of all p will remain same*/
